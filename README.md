# stopwatch
I'm trying to test my JS skills by creating a simple stopwatch timer.
There may be several errors on this end.
The stopwatch has a basic javascript setting with a start and stop function.
It does not reset when you restart it.
It was meant to test out using the setInterval function and the loops that enable the timer to run
